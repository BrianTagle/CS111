lab1b-client: The implementation of the client part of the project.  connects to the server implementation and
	      sends input from the user (through the keyboard) to the server. if --encrypt is enabled, encrypts
	      data sent to the server and decrypts data from the server using the provided key.  if --log is
	      enabled, writes the amount of bytes sent and recieved as well as what is written and
	      read to the connection socket to the chosen log file.
lab1b-server: The implementation of the server part of this project.  recieves input from a client and sends
	      that input to a forked shell process which executes the commands from the client.  if
	      --encrypt is enabled, the server decrypts incoming data from the shell and encrypts data it
	      sends back to the client with the provided key.
my.key: The key to be provided to the client and the server to do their encryption and decryption.  This key
	was made by hitting random keys on my keyboard.
Makefile: The makefile for this projects that has the default make option which compiles both the server and
	  client.  Also options for compiling the server and client individual.  Has options to clean and
	  make the distribution tarball.
README: Contains a description of the tarball contents as well as notes about research for this project.

Notes:	My research mainly consisted of reviewing the slides of my TA Diyu Zhou and looking up manual pages
	for mcrypt and the various functions needed to create a connection between server and client
	(socket() for example).  The example code provided by my TA helped me understand how to implement
	the different features of this project correctly.
