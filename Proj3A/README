Makefile - makefile for this project with default, dist, and clean targets
README - lists contents of the dist file and some notes on the project
lab3a.c - source code for this lab that examines an image from the EXT2 filesystem
	and outputs various info on the blocks and bitmaps of the image provided.
ext2_fs.h - header file containing important functions that allow the lab3a.c
	  code to gather information on the provided EXT2 image.  I included
	  this in the dist tarball because otherwise my dist does not pass
	  the sanity check.

Notes:
	I would like to thank my TA, Diyu Zhou, and his slides for helping me
	figure out what functions to use from the ext2_fs.h file and how to use them

	In my code, I have several successive fprintf statements that could be
	condensed into a single fprintf.  I mostly did this for my own clarity
	when writing the code.  This approach may seem wasteful but as I learned
	in CS35L, fprintf buffers writes, so my approach doesnt add a huge
	amount of overhead.
