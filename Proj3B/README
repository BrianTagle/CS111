contents:

Makefile - makefile for this project with default, dist, and clean targets
README - lists contents of the dist file and some notes on the project
lab3b.py - source code for this lab that examines a csv file and looks for any
	 inconsistencies.  The  data that was formatted the same as what we generated in lab3a.  
Notes:
	I would like to thank my TA, Diyu Zhou, and his slides for helping me
	figure out what some basic algorithims to sort through the data

	I used python because it was  recommended in the lab spec.  Also when I
	originally tied to use C++, the linux server didnt have the library I
	needed to make it work.
