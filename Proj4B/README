Contents:
Makefile - makefile with default, check, clean, and dist targets
lab4b.c - Source code for the temperature reporting program.  Reports the temperature at a regular interval(period) on a specified scale (C or F).
	supports a --log option which will log the reported temperatures and commands from STDIN.  The commands from STDIN allow the user to change
	the period and scale during runtime as well as pause the program and log things to the logfile.  You can shut off the program with a
	command to STDIN or by pressing the button which generates an interrupt that shuts down the program.
test.sh -testing script that runs a quick smoke check on the lab4b executable
README -readme with details on contents of the tarball and various notes on the project

This project was extremely generally and basically gave no instructions as to what the program should do for bad STDIN commands or options.  For
the most part my program continues to run if given bad options and makes no changes based on bad arguments and reports something to stderr. Also
since the program logs valid or invalid commands, the LOG instruction is useless except for the fact that if you use LOG the program will not
report anything to stderr.

I would like to thank my TA Diyu Zhou and his slides that helped me implement various features of this program which include the temperation conversion
and reporting the real time.
